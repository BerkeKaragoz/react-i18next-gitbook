# Extracting translations

At some point you will come to the question how to get new translation key/values into your namespace \(translation\) file.

## 1\) Adding new strings manually

Why for sure this is the last efficient method for adding new translations we know a lot of projects doing this. There is actually nothing wrong with it beside being some extra work developers could avoid.

## 2\) Using an extraction tool

You can either use the [i18next-parser](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-parser) or [i18next-scanner](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-scanner) to extract all the strings from your code files.

## 3\) Runtime extraction

I18next has a setting to send all keys that it was unable to resolve during runtime using the attached backend.

In case of the xhr-backend just set `saveMissing: true` on init:

```javascript
import i18n from "i18next";
import detector from "i18next-browser-languagedetector";
import backend from "i18next-xhr-backend";
import { reactI18nextModule } from "react-i18next";

i18n
  .use(detector)
  .use(backend)
  .use(reactI18nextModule) // passes i18n down to react-i18next
  .init({
    lng: "en",
    fallbackLng: "en", // use en if detected lng is not available
    
    saveMissing: true, // send not translated keys to endpoint
     
    keySeparator: false, // we do not use keys in form messages.welcome

    interpolation: {
      escapeValue: false // react already safes from xss
    }
  )};
  
export default i18n;
```

Check the [options](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-xhr-backend#backend-options) for where missing translation gets send.

This is the most convenient way of working with react-i18next just develop and run your applications without worrying to much about adding translations to your catalog as those get added automatically.

Wanna have this process on steroids? Just hook up a [locize.com](https://locize.com) localization project using the provided backend and get both the saveMissing and loading of translations automated in a true continuous localization process.
