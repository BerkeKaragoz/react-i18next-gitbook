# Drawbacks of other i18n solutions

Lets make the sample using our own base i18n framework [i18next](https://i18next.com). Like all other solutions those come with some drawbacks we will highlight after creating the samples.

## Using a pure javascript i18n framework

```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import i18n from "i18next";

// translation catalog
const resources = {
  en: {
    translation: {
      "Welcome to React": "Welcome to React and react-i18next"
    }
  }
};

// initialize i18next with catalog and language to use
i18n.init({
  resources,
  lng: "en"
});

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>{i18next.t('Welcome to React')}</h2>;
  }
}

// append app to dom
ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

## More react adapted "react-i18n"

The above is basically how every i18n framework for react works out there. The translations and language get set on init and a translation function is made available. You easily could extend this hiding the i18n.init inside a provider and pass down t function by context to another component for translated strings.

So lets make this more visible with some pseudo code:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { I18nProvider, FormattedString } from "i18nLib";

// import translation catalog
import resources from './catalog-en.json';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h2><FormttedString msg="Welcome to React" /></h2>;
  }
}

// append app to dom
ReactDOM.render(
  <I18nProvider lng="en" resources={resources}>
    <App />,
  </I18nProvider>
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

## The drawbacks

Before we come to the drawbacks lets highlight some advantage of those solutions above - they are very simple to get started.

### Changing the language

Can you easily change the language? Get the translations in other language loaded? Does the language change trigger a rerender?

That's what the [withNamespaces](../components/withnamespaces.md) higher order component or [NamespacesConsumer](../components/namespacesconsumer.md) render prop do!

### Scale and split your translations into multiple files

When your project you do not only want to have code splitting but you also like to load translations on demand to avoid loading all translations upfront resulting in bad load times of your website.

With loading translations asynchronous there comes an other problem - does your framework handle the pending state during loading translation?

That's what the [withNamespaces](../components/withnamespaces.md) higher order component or [NamespacesConsumer](../components/namespacesconsumer.md) render prop do!

### Can you translate combined jsx nodes in one sentence

Lets take following content:

```javascript
<p>
  Hello <strong>{name}</strong>, you have 
  <Link to="/msgs">{count} unread message(s)</Link>.
</p>
```

In most frameworks you will end having to split this into multiple translation strings. But for your translators it would make sense to have this as one sentence to translate like eg.:

```text
Hello <1>{name}</1>, you have <3>{count} unread message(s)</3>.
```

You can do this using the [Trans component](../components/trans-component.md).
