# What is react-i18next?

react-i18next is an **internationalization** addon for **reactjs** and is based on [i18next](http://i18next.com).

The module asserts that needed translations get loaded for your components and that your content gets rerendered on language changes.

As react-i18next builds on [i18next](http://i18next.com) you can use it on any other UI framework or on the server (node.js) too. As react philosophy: **Learn once - use everywhere**.
